The weakly augmented image is passed to our model and we get prediction over classes. The probability for the most confident class is compared to a threshold. If it is above the threshold, then we take that class as the ground label i.e. pseudo-label. Then, the strongly augmented image is passed through our model to get a prediction over classes.

"An early highlight was the excellent survey of analysis methods by Belinkov & Glass (2019). This year was also the first one (in my memory) where many papers were dedicated to analysing a single model, BERT (such papers are known as BERTology). In this context, probes (see the figure below), which aim to understand whether a model captures morphology, syntax, etc. by predicting certain properties have become a common tool. I particularly appreciated papers that make probes more reliable (Liu et al., 2019; Hewitt & Liang, 2019). Reliability is also a theme in the ongoing conversation on whether attention provides meaningful explanations (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Wiegreffe & Pinter, 2019; Wallace, 2019).

"When you boil it down, the factors that determine what a company can and cannot do‚Äîits capabilities‚Äîfall into one of three buckets: resources, processes, and priorities. These offer an accurate snapshot of a company at any given time, because they are mutually exclusive (a part of a business cannot fit into more than one of the categories) and are collectively exhaustive (together, the three categories account for everything inside of the business).

"Many products fail because companies develop them from the wrong perspective. Companies focus too much on what they want to sell their customers, rather than what those customers really need.

"possible‚Äîso that the entrepreneurs don‚Äôt spend a lot of money in pursuit of the wrong strategy. Given that 93 percent of companies that ended up being successful had to change their initial strategy, any capital that demands that the early company become very big, very fast, will almost always drive the business off a cliff instead. A big company will burn through money much faster, and a big organization is much harder to change than a small one. Motorola learned this lesson with Iridium. That is why capital that seeks growth before profits is bad capital. But the reason why both types of capital appear in the name of the theory is that once a viable strategy has been found, investors need to change what they seek‚Äîthey should become impatient for growth and patient for profit. Once a profitable and viable way forward has been discovered‚Äîsuccess now depends on scaling out this model.",How Will You Measure Your Life?,"James  Allworth, Karen Dillon, and Clayton  Christensen",B006I1AE92,,yellow,,location,1036,2012-10-01 04:56:00+00:00
"At a basic level, there are two goals investors have when they put money into a company: growth and profitability. Neither is easy. Professor Amar Bhide showed in his Origin and Evolution of New Business that 93 percent of all companies that ultimately become successful had to abandon their original strategy‚Äîbecause the original plan proved not to be viable. In other words, successful companies don‚Äôt succeed because they have the right strategy at the beginning; but rather, because they have money left over after the original strategy fails, so that they can pivot and try another approach. Most of those that fail, in contrast, spend all their money on their original strategy‚Äîwhich is usually wrong. The theory of good money and bad money essentially frames Bhide‚Äôs work as a simple assertion. When the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth but impatient for profit. It demands that a new company figures out a viable strategy as fast as and with as little investment as",How Will You Measure Your Life?,"James  Allworth, Karen Dillon, and Clayton  Christensen",B006I1AE92,,yellow,,location,1027,2012-10-01 04:56:00+00:00
"A strategy‚Äîwhether in companies or in life‚Äîis created through hundreds of everyday decisions about how you spend your time, energy, and money. With every moment of your time, every decision about how you spend your energy and your money, you are making a statement about what really matters to you. You can talk all you want about having a clear purpose and strategy for your life, but ultimately this means nothing if you are not investing the resources you have in a way that is consistent with your strategy. In the end, a strategy is nothing but good intentions unless it‚Äôs effectively implemented. How do you make sure that you‚Äôre implementing the strategy you truly want to implement? Watch where your resources flow‚Äîthe resource allocation process. If it is not supporting the strategy you‚Äôve decided upon, you run the risk of a serious problem. You might think you are a charitable person, but how often do you really give your time or money to a cause or an organization that you care about? If your family matters most to you, when you think about all the choices you‚Äôve made with your time in a week, does your family seem to come out on top? Because if the decisions you make about where you invest your blood, sweat, and tears are not consistent with the person you aspire to be, you‚Äôll never become that person.",How Will You Measure Your Life?,"James  Allworth, Karen Dillon, and Clayton  Christensen",B006I1AE92,,yellow,,location,917,2012-10-01 04:56:00+00:00

"Hopefully, you‚Äôre going to go off into the world with an understanding of what makes us tick. But speaking from my own experience, it can be tough to find the right career to do that for you. What we can learn from how companies develop strategy is that although it is hard to get it right at first, success doesn‚Äôt rely on this. Instead, it hinges on continuing to experiment until you do find an approach that works. Only a lucky few companies start off with the strategy that ultimately leads to success. Once you understand the concept of emergent and deliberate strategy, you‚Äôll know that if you‚Äôve yet to find something that really works in your career, expecting to have a clear vision of where your life will take you is just wasting time. Even worse, it may actually close your mind to unexpected opportunities. While you are still figuring out your career, you should keep the aperture of your life wide open. Depending on your particular circumstances, you should be prepared to experiment with different opportunities, ready to pivot, and continue to adjust your strategy until you find what it is that both satisfies the hygiene factors and gives you all the motivators.

"Before you take a job, carefully list what things others are going to need to do or to deliver in order for you to successfully achieve what you hope to do. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat are the assumptions that have to prove true in order for me to be able to succeed in this assignment?‚Äù List them. Are they within your control? Equally important, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy in the choice you are contemplating. Are you basing your position on extrinsic or intrinsic motivators? Why do you think this is going to be something you enjoy doing? What evidence do you have? Every time you consider a career move, keep thinking about the most important assumptions that have to prove true, and how you can swiftly and inexpensively test if they are valid.

"Only after you understand the relative importance of all the underlying assumptions should you green-light the team‚Äîbut not in the way that most companies tend to do.

"There‚Äôs a tool that can help you test whether your deliberate strategy or a new emergent one will be a fruitful approach. It forces you to articulate what assumptions need to be proved true in order for the strategy to succeed.

"But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The process of strategy then reiterates through these steps over and over again, constantly evolving. In other words, strategy is not a discrete analytical event‚Äîsomething decided, say, in a meeting of top managers based on the best numbers and analysis available at the time. Rather, it is a continuous, diverse, and unruly process. Managing it is very hard‚Äîthe deliberate strategy and the new emerging opportunities fight for resources.

"The unanticipated problems and opportunities then essentially fight the deliberate strategy for the attention, capital, and hearts of the management and employees. The company has to decide whether to stick with the original plan, modify it, or even replace it altogether with one of the alternatives that arises.

"The theory of motivation suggests you need to ask yourself a different set of questions than most of us are used to asking. Is this work meaningful to me?

"Herzberg notes the common assumption that job satisfaction is one big continuous spectrum‚Äîstarting with very happy on one end and reaching all the way down to absolutely miserable on the other‚Äîis not actually the way the mind works. Instead, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures. This means, for example, that it‚Äôs possible to love your job and hate it at the same time. Let me explain. This theory distinguishes between two different types of factors: hygiene factors and motivation factors. On one side of the equation, there are the elements of work that, if not done right, will cause us to be dissatisfied. These are called hygiene factors. Hygiene factors are things like status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices. It matters, for example, that you don‚Äôt have a manager who manipulates you for his own purposes‚Äîor who doesn‚Äôt hold you accountable for things over which you don‚Äôt have responsibility.

"The final element is execution. The only way a strategy can get implemented is if we dedicate resources to it. Good intentions are not enough‚Äîyou‚Äôre not implementing the strategy that you intend if you don‚Äôt spend your time, your money, and your talent in a way that is consistent with your intentions. In your life, there are going to be constant demands for your time and attention. How are you going to decide which of those demands gets resources? The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward. That‚Äôs a dangerous way to build a strategy. All of these factors‚Äîpriorities, balancing plans with opportunities, and allocating your resources‚Äîcombine to create your strategy.

You should learn all that you can from the past; from scholars who have studied it, and from people who have gone through problems of the sort that you are likely to face. But this doesn‚Äôt solve the fundamental challenge of what information and what advice you should accept, and which you should ignore as you embark into the future. Instead, using robust theory to predict what will happen has a much greater chance of success.

Interacting with cache servers is simple because most cache servers provide APIs for common programming languages. Figure 8 shows how a typical memcache API looks like. All you need to specify is the key of the value you want to store and time to live (TTL) after which the object would be removed from the cache.,System Design Interview ‚Äì An insider‚Äôs guide,Alex,B072HDQ338,,yellow,,location,209,2019-11-28 04:56:00+00:00
"The cache tier is a temporary data store layer, which is much faster than the database. The benefits of having a separate cache tier are better utilization of memory and CPU resources and having the ability to scale the cache tier independently of other tiers. Figure 7 shows a possible setup for a cache tier: A web server, after receiving a request, first checks if the cache has the response available. If so, it sends the data to the client. If not, it queries the database, and stores the response in itself and sends it back to the client. This way, the load to database is reduced.",System Design Interview ‚Äì An insider‚Äôs guide,Alex,B072HDQ338,,yellow,,location,203,2019-11-28 04:56:00+00:00

"If the master database goes offline, a slave database could be promoted to be the new master. All the database operations will be temporarily executed on the new master database. A new slave database needs to be setup for replication as soon as possible. In production systems, promoting a new master is more complicated because data in a slave database might not up to date.
